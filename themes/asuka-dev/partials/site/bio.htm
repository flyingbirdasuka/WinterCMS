                    <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto text-center"><p class="large text-muted">I have been living, studying and working in the Netherlands since 2006. In 2018 I founded my own dance business called ‘Asuka Method’, this was designed to train the body and increase mind awareness in order to get the best potential out of people and to help them to reach their personal goals. During this time I have been designing, marketing and managing my Wordpress website, it was through this that I became more interested in web development and decided to pursue this route for my career. Prior to this I was previously working as a professional dancer and dance teacher. I am very open-minded, highly organized, a problem solver as well as a creative thinker. I can work independently on my own and also like learning from and helping other people as a team. I am always eager to learn and a fast learner - a lot of people call me a sponge.</p>
